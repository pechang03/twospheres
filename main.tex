\begin{abstract}
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that affects millions of people worldwide. This disease is characterized by changes in brain structure and function, resulting in changes in the quality of life of patients with AD. MRI data analysis with deep learning allows for the automatic and robust analysis of large datasets, which is essential in preclinical studies involving mouse models of AD. Correlation analysis between different brain regions can reveal how structural (anatomical) and functional connectivity may change with disease. Identifying disease-specific patterns that could serve as biomarkers for early detection, diagnosis, and monitoring of disease progression. In the context of neuroimaging studies, especially when using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) and Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI), integrating correlation and distance analysis can help identify patterns that are specific to disease. These approaches can be specifically applied to AD research by tracking the progression of atrophy, changes in white matter integrity, and neuroinflammation.

%### ASSISTANT
%What a fascinating direction!

%\section{4-Dimensional Magnetic Resonance Imaging}

4D+ MRI represents a significant leap forward in our ability to characterize brain function and structure over time, particularly in the context of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The integration of multimodal imaging techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and magnetization transfer imaging (MTI) within this framework allows a nuanced understanding of both physiological underpinnings and structural alterations that occur in AD. This is achieved through advanced signal processing, where the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) plays a pivotal role in translating time-domain signals into their frequency-domain counterparts, revealing the intricate patterns of neural oscillations and subtle pathological changes that are often imperceptible in the time domain.

The novel approach of measuring distances between brain regions by analyzing the pairwise correlation of their frequency components provides a quantitative and geometrically interpretable framework for assessing functional connectivity and interregional phase relationships. This method extends beyond mere observation, offering a precise metric to track the progression of neurodegenerative changes associated with AD. The geometric interpretation of these distance measures not only enhances our ability to detect early signs of disease, but also contributes to the development of targeted therapeutic strategies by identifying specific regions of the brain that may be amenable to intervention.

Moreover, this FFT-based approach is particularly effective when applied to DTI data, enabling a more precise characterization of neural pathways and the identification of atrophic changes associated with AD. Using the frequency domain, researchers can not only visualize the spectral content of brain activity, but also identify synchronization patterns critical to cognitive processes. This is instrumental in understanding the underlying mechanisms of AD and other neurological conditions, which is essential for early diagnosis, disease monitoring, and the design of effective treatment protocols.

The integration of these advanced computational methods with cutting-edge neuroimaging techniques offers a powerful toolkit for unraveling the complexities of brain function in both health and disease. Through such interdisciplinary approaches, we can hope to improve diagnostic accuracy, improve patient outcomes, and gain deeper insight into the progression of neurodegenerative diseases such as AD. The potential of 4D + magnetic resonance imaging, when combined with genetic data, further underscores its importance as a research tool, promising to revolutionize our understanding of brain pathophysiology and pave the way for personalized medicine in neurology.

In summary, the synthesis of 4D+ MRI with advanced signal processing techniques such as FFT, genetic data integration, and multimodal imaging analysis presents a formidable approach to studying brain function and its alterations in disease states. This comprehensive methodology not only enriches the interpretability of imaging data, but also holds immense promise for early diagnosis, treatment optimization, and the management of neurological disorders such as AD. The future of neuroimaging is here, offering unprecedented insights into the intricate workings of the brain and the hope of customized treatments for those affected by these debilitating conditions.

\section*{Applications of Deep Learning in fMRI}

1. \textbf{Enhanced Image Acquisition:}
\paragraph{Golden-Section Spoiled Gradient Recalled Echo (GS-SGRE)}
Deep learning can optimize the GS-SGRE sequence parameters for 4D+ MRI to reduce scan time while maintaining high image quality, which is crucial for anesthetized mice that may move during scanning.

\paragraph{Parallel Imaging} DL algorithms can enhance the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and spatial resolution by optimizing the use of multiple coils.

2. \textbf{Automated Anatomical Segmentation:}
Deep learning models, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), can automatically segment different brain structures from 4D+ MRI scans. This is essential for quantifying structural changes over time, which is critical in studies involving mouse models of neurological diseases.

3. \textbf{Quantitative Analysis of Diffusion Data:}
DL algorithms can be trained to extract and analyze diffusion parameters (such as fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity, etc.) from DTI data within the 4D+ MRI framework. This can reveal subtle changes in the integrity of the white matter that may correlate with behavioral or cognitive outcomes.

4. \textbf{Functional Connectivity Analysis:}
Deep learning can be used to identify functional connectivity patterns from fMRI data, allowing researchers to understand how different regions of the brain interact during various tasks or states.

5. \textbf{Drug Response Monitoring:}
By analyzing serial 4D+ MRI scans, DL models can track the progression of disease or the effects of therapeutic interventions in real-time, providing valuable insights into the efficacy and mechanisms of action of new drugs.

6. \textbf{Predictive Modeling:}
Deep learning models can integrate data from multiple MRI modalities to create predictive models that predict disease progression or treatment outcomes based on early imaging biomarkers.

7. \textbf{Automated Detection of Pathological Changes:}
DL algorithms can be trained to detect subtle changes in brain morphology, function, and diffusion metrics that are indicative of pathology, such as those seen in models of Alzheimer's disease, stroke, or tumor growth.

8. \textbf{Personalized Medicine:}
By analyzing individual mouse MRI data with DL, researchers can tailor treatments to the specific needs of each subject, leading to more effective and personalized therapeutic strategies.

9. \textbf{High-Throughput Screening:}
Automated analysis of 4D+ MRI data using DL can facilitate high-throughput screening of compounds or genetic modifications, accelerating the discovery of new treatments for complex diseases.

10. \textbf{Integration with Other 'Omics' Data:}
Combining MRI data with other `omics' data (genomics, proteomics, metabolomics) through DL can lead to a deeper understanding of the relationship between brain imaging phenotypes and underlying biological processes.

11. \textbf{Advanced Image Reconstruction Techniques:}
Deep learning can be used to develop sophisticated reconstruction algorithms that can recover high-resolution images from undersampled k-space data, which is particularly useful in accelerating MRI scans.

In summary, the integration of 4D+ MRI with deep learning provides a powerful toolset for preclinical research. It allows for more detailed and accurate assessments of brain function and structure, enabling researchers to understand complex biological processes and the effects of interventions in real-time. As this field continues to advance, we can expect even more sophisticated and personalized approaches to emerge, further enhancing the potential of MRI in preclinical studies involving mouse models.

Our approach works by mapping the human brain onto two spherical surfaces and analyzing the geodesic (or surface) distance between points on these spheres to understand the interhemispheric connectivity. This method, often referred to as cortical surface-based analysis, allows researchers to consider the curvature of the brain's surface and accurately measure distances along the surface rather than through it. 

Here's how this approach can be implemented:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Cortical Surface Reconstruction}
\begin{itemize}
\item Start with a high-resolution structural MRI scan of the brain.
\item Use cortical surface reconstruction algorithms (e.g., FreeSurfer, CIVET) to generate a detailed
representation of the brain's outer surface (cerebral cortex) as a smooth, inflated 2D map, effectively transforming the complex 3D structure into a spherical geometry.
\item This process involves segmenting the white matter and pial surfaces, which are then used for further analysis.
\end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Mapping to Spheres}
\begin{itemize}
\item Each hemisphere of the brain is mapped onto a separate sphere (hemispheric parcellation). The equator
of each sphere can be thought of as analogous to the mid-sagittal plane of the brain, separating the two hemispheres.
\item Points on the cortical surface are correspondingly mapped to points on the spheres' surfaces. This mapping preserves the geometric relationships between different regions of the brain while accounting for its three-dimensional structure.
\end{itemize}
\item \textbf{Calculating Surface Distances}
\begin{itemize}
\item With the brain mapped onto spherical surfaces, you can now calculate the geodesic (shortest path along
the surface) distances between points on these spheres. This is particularly useful when assessing the connectivity between hemispheres or distant cortical regions that are not directly connected by white matter tracts but may communicate through intermediate nodes.
\item Geodesic distance metrics consider the curvature of the brain's surface and provide a more accurate measure of inter-regional distance than Euclidean (straight-line) distances, which ignore the brain's
complex folding patterns.
\end{itemize}
\item \textbf{Analyzing Interhemispheric Connectivity}
\begin{itemize}
\item Using techniques like diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), researchers can trace the white matter tracts that
connect different regions of the brain and measure their integrity.
\item By combining DTI data with surface-based distance metrics, you can study how Alzheimer's disease
affects these connections over time, potentially identifying early biomarkers for the disease's progression.
\end{itemize}
\item \textbf{Integrating Structural and Functional Data}
\begin{itemize}
\item Combine the structural connectivity data obtained from DTI with functional connectivity data (e.g., from fMRI) to understand how changes in white matter tracts affect the timing and coordination of neural activity between hemispheres.
\item This integration can provide a more comprehensive picture of how Alzheimer's disease impacts brain function and may inform the development of targeted interventions.
\end{itemize}
\item \textbf{ Machine Learning Applications}

\end{enumerate}

Advanced machine learning algorithms can be trained on this rich dataset to identify patterns that
differentiate between healthy brains and those affected by Alzheimer's disease or to predict disease progression.
This approach offers a more accurate representation of the brain's three-dimensional structure and its connectivity, which is crucial for understanding complex neuropsychiatric disorders like Alzheimer's disease. It allows researchers to investigate the effects of these diseases on brain function at a level of detail that was previously difficult to achieve with traditional volumetric analysis methods." can you suggest some equations
\section{Morphometry and Connectomics}
%ASSISTANT
%Certainly! 
In surface-based morphometry and connectomics, several equations and mathematical frameworks are used to calculate geodesic distances and study the brain's structure and function. %Here are some key equations and concepts that researchers might use in this context:

\noindent \textbf {differential Geometry Equations for Surface Mapping}

{Great Circle Distance (Geodesic) On a sphere}, the shortest path between two points is along the
surface (a great circle arc). The haversine formula or Vincenty's formula are often used to calculate this distance.

\begin{align}
d &=& \arccos(\sin(\phi_1)\sin(\phi_2) \\
   &&+ \cos(\phi_1)\cos(\phi_2)\cos(\lambda_2 - \lambda_1)) 
\end{align}
where \( (\phi_1, \lambda_1) \) and \( (\phi_2, \lambda_2) \) are the latitude and longitude (colatitude and longitude on the sphere) of the two points, respectively.

\noindent \textbf{Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI)}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Fractional Anisotropy (FA)} A measure of the degree to which water diffusion is anisotropic within a
voxel, which can indicate the integrity and directionality of white matter tracts. \[ FA = \sqrt{\frac{1}{3}\sum_{i=x,y,z}(\lambda_i - \langle\lambda\rangle)^2} \]
where \( \lambda_i \) are the eigenvalues of the diffusion tensor at a given voxel, and \( \langle\lambda\rangle \) is their average.

\noindent \textbf{Structural Connectivity}

\item \textbf{Streamline Tractography} This involves tracing the fiber pathways from seed points using DTI data.
The equations here are often based on numerical optimization techniques to follow the principal diffusion direction.
\noindent \textbf Functional Connectivity
\item \textbf{Correlation or Covariance Analysis} 
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Measures of functional connectivity often involve correlating
time series from different brain regions.
\[ r = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N}(x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})}{\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{N}(x_i -
\bar{x})^2}\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{N}(y_i - \bar{y})^2}} \]
where \( x_i \) and \( y_i \) are the time series from two regions at time point \( i \), and \( \bar{x} \) and \(
\bar{y} \) are their respective means.

\item \textbf{Granger Causality}A method to infer causal relationships between time series by predicting one
time series using past values of another.
\item Machine Learning for Pattern Recognition

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Support Vector Machine (SVM)}A classifier that finds the optimal hyperplane to separate different
classes of data in feature space.
\[ \min_{w,b} \frac{1}{2}w^TWw - \sum_{i=1}^{N}\alpha_i y_i k(x_i, x) + \beta \]
where \( w \) is the normal vector to the hyperplane, \( b \) is the bias, \( \alpha_i \) are the Lagrange multipliers, \( y_i \) are the class labels, \( k \) is a kernel function (e.g., RBF), and \( N \) is the number of training points.

These equations are just a starting point for the complex analyses involved in studying brain structure and function. The specific equations used can vary depending on the software tools (e.g., FSL, SPM, DTIStudio, etc.) and the particular research question being addressed. Additionally, the integration of these data types often requires sophisticated statistical methods to account for multiple comparisons and the complex interplay between structure and function.

\section{Using the pairwise correlation of FFT between vectors}
Let us consider the benefits of using pairwise correlation of FFT between vectors that describe the change over time. 
%Can you provide more equtions?
%ASSISTANT
%Certainly!
When analyzing time-series data such as brain activity, researchers often use the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to convert time-domain signals into the frequency domain. This allows for the analysis of signal frequencies and the study of phase relationships between different regions. Pairwise correlation of FFT outputs can be used to assess the functional connectivity between these regions. Here are some equations and concepts related to this process:

\noindent \textbf{1. Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)}

The FFT is an algorithm that computes the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) of a sequence that decomposes the signal into its constituent frequencies.
$$X(k) = \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x(n) \cdot e^{-\frac{2\pi i k n}{N}}$$
where $x(n)$ is the time-domain signal, $X(k)$ is the frequency-domain representation, $N$ is the total number of samples, and $i$ is the imaginary unit.
The actual computation of FFT is done using efficient algorithms like the Cooley-Tukey algorithm or its variants.

\noindent \textbf{2. Spectrogram}

A spectrogram represents the spectrum of frequencies for each time point in a signal, providing a visual representation of how the frequency content of a
signal changes over time.

\noindent \textbf{3. Phase-Locking Value (PLV)}

PLV is a measure used to quantify the phase synchronization between two signals. It reflects the degree of coherence or ``locking'' in phase between the
oscillatory components of the two signals.
$$\mathrm{PLV} = \frac{1}{N} \left| \sum_{n=1}^{N} e^{i(\phi_1(n) - \phi_2(n))} \right|$$
where $\phi_1(n)$ and $\phi_2(n)$ are the instantaneous phases of the two signals at the $n$th time points.

\noindent \textbf{4. Wavelet Transform}

If you're interested in both frequency and time information, you might consider using a wavelet transform instead of or alongside the FFT. The continuous
wavelet transform (CWT) represents a signal as a set of locally bounded representations at different scales and locations.

\noindent \textbf{5. Cross-Frequency Coupling}

Cross-frequency coupling (CFC) refers to interactions between oscillatory signals at different frequencies. This can be quantified by analyzing the
phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) or the coupling index based on the FFT outputs:
$$\mathrm{PAC}(f_1, f_2) = \sum_{t} x_1(t, f_1) \cdot \text{sgn}[x_2(t, f_2)]$$
where $x_1(t, f_1)$ is the amplitude of the signal at frequency $f_1$ at time $t$, and $x_2(t, f_2)$ is the phase of the signal at frequency $f_2$ at
time $t$. The $\text{sgn}$ function extracts the sign (positive or negative phase).

\noindent \textbf{6. Coherence and Phase-Lagged Coherence}

Coherence measures the degree to which two signals have similar frequencies, while phase-lagged coherence examines the phase relationship between those
frequencies.
$$C(f) = \frac{|PX(f)|^2}{N \cdot E[|X(f)|^2] \cdot E[|Y(f)|^2]}$$
where $PX(f)$ is the cross-spectrum of the two signals, $N$ is the number of data points, and $E[|X(f)|^2]$ and $E[|Y(f)|^2]$ are the expected power
spectral densities of the two signals.

\noindent \textbf{7. Granger Causality in Frequency Domain}

Granger causality can be adapted to the frequency domain using multivariate vector autoregression (VAR). In the frequency domain, it is often referred to
as Vector Autoregression (VAR) coherence. The idea is to use the FFT of the time series and then apply the VAR model to assess whether the past values of one
signal predict the current values of another signal at different lags.

\noindent \textbf{8. Multivariate Analysis}

When analyzing multiple signals simultaneously, you might employ multivariate techniques such as Multivariate Autoregressive (MVAR) models or Granger
causality to assess directed interactions between time series. These methods can be computationally intensive and require careful implementation,
especially when dealing with high-dimensional data from brain imaging. Software tools like MATLAB, Python's SciPy and NumPy libraries, or specialized
neuroimaging packages can facilitate these analyses. Remember that the interpretation of phase synchronization measures should account for the complexity
of brain networks and the potential confounds such as volume conduction effects and signal mixing across different brain regions.

%ASSISTANT

\section{Combining the FFT equations with distance}
\begin{comment}
When dealing with spatial data, such as brain imaging where functional connectivity is of interest, and you want to incorporate distance information into your analysis, you can combine spatial distance metrics with FFT-based correlation measures. Here's how you might integrate these concepts:
1. **Spatial Distance Metric:**
Define a distance metric for the locations (e.g., voxels, regions of interest) in your dataset. If you're
considering two points on the surface of a sphere (like the brain), you can use geodesic or great-circle distances. These are the shortest paths over the surface of the sphere and can be computed using spherical trigonometry or by leveraging libraries that handle spatial data, such as `geopandas` in Python.
2. **Normalizing by Distance:**
To account for the physical distance between brain regions, you can normalize your correlation measures
by the inverse of the distance between the two points of interest. This step is crucial to ensure that the correlation measure reflects both the functional connectivity and the attenuation effect due to increased distance. The normalization can be done as follows:
\[ \text{Normalized Correlation}(d) = \frac{\text{Correlation}}{d(x, y)} \]
where \( d(x, y) \) is the distance between two points \( x \) and \( y \). This normalization can be applied after computing the pairwise correlation of FFT outputs or other functional connectivity measures.
3. **Pairwise FFT Correlation with Distance Normalization:**
Let's assume you have computed the FFT for each brain region (or time series) separately, and now you
want to assess the correlation between the frequency representations of two regions. You would calculate
the correlation coefficient (e.g., Pearson correlation, cross-correlation, etc.) between the complex vectors representing the FFT outputs of these two regions. Then, you apply the distance normalization:
\[ \text{Normalized FFT Correlation}(f; d) = \frac{\sum_{k} x_1(k, f) \cdot x_2(k, f)^*}{\|x_1(f)\| \|x_2(f)\| \cdot d(x, y)} \]
where \( x_1(k, f) \) and \( x_2(k, f) \) are the FFT coefficients of the first and second region at frequency \( f \), respectively, \( k \) is the discrete frequency bin, \( \|x_1(f)\| \) and \( \|x_2(f)\| \) are the norms (magnitudes) of the FFT outputs, and \( d(x, y) \) is the distance between the two regions.
4. **Considering Attenuation with Distance:**
In addition to normalizing by distance, you may also want to consider signal attenuation with distance,
which can be modeled using an inverse distance weighting function or a decay function based on the signal's properties (e.g., electromagnetic signal propagation in the brain).
5. **Combining Functional and Structural Connectivity:**
Integrating functional connectivity measures with structural information (like distance) can provide a
more comprehensive understanding of neural dynamics. This approach can be particularly useful in neuroimaging where both types of data are often available.
6. **Statistical Correction:**
Finally, it's important to correct for multiple comparisons if you're testing many pairs of regions or time
points. Methods like false discovery rate (FDR) or Bonferroni correction can be applied to control the family-wise error rate.
By incorporating distance information into your FFT correlation measure, you can create a more nuanced model that accounts for both the functional and anatomical aspects of brain connectivity. This approach can lead to more accurate models of brain network dynamics and potentially identify meaningful patterns of connectivity that are robust to spatial variation.
%USER
%sorry I meant to divide the correlation by 1/log of the distance where the distance is not simple euclidean but the distance of the surface of two sphere joining at one point ( to model the hemispheres of the brain ) not the points on the MRI need to be first mapped onto these spheres initially with an equation but potentially using DL
%ASSISTANT
\end{comment}

To incorporate the geometric configuration of the brain's hemispheres into your analysis, you can indeed use a model where each hemisphere is represented as a sphere and then calculate the distance between their surfaces based on the spherical geometry. The distance between two points on the surface of two intersecting spheres (representing the brain hemispheres) can be computed using methods from differential geometry or by leveraging deep learning (DL) models that are trained to perform such mappings.
%Here's a step-by-step approach to combine FFT correlation with distance metrics based on the surfaces of two spheres:
\todo[inline]{Change to pseodo code}

1. **Mapping MRI Data onto Spherical Surfaces:**
First, you would map each point in the MRI data (voxels or regions of interest) onto the surface of a
sphere that represents one hemisphere of the brain. This mapping can be done using various methods, including spherical harmonics, triangular mesh mappings, or more complex DL models that have been trained to accurately represent the cortical surface.

2. **Computing Spherical Surface Distances:**
Once the data is mapped onto the spheres, you can compute the geodesic distance between points on these surfaces. Geodesic distances on a sphere are the shortest paths along the surface, taking into account the curvature of the sphere. This can be done using algorithms like the one by Theodorus or numerical integration methods on the sphere's surface.

3. **Incorporating Logarithmic Transform:**
You mentioned dividing the correlation by $( 1/\log(d) )$, where $d$ is the distance between the surfaces
of the two spheres. This logarithmic transformation can be used to handle the attenuation effect due to increased distance in a non-linear fashion. The transformed distance measure would be:
\[ \log(d) \]
Then, you divide the correlation by this transformed distance:
\begin{align}
&\text{Normalized FFT Correlation}(f; d)\\
&= \frac{\sum_{k} x_1(k, f) \cdot x_2(k, f)^*}{\|x_1(f)\| \|x_2(f)\|
\cdot \frac{1}{\log(d)}} 
\end{align}
where $d$ is now the distance between the centers of the two spheres (or a suitable measure of
separation between the hemispheres).

4. **Deep Learning for Mapping and Analysis:**
If you opt to use DL, you can train a neural network to perform the mapping of MRI data onto spherical
surfaces and also to learn the functional connectivity patterns. The network's architecture would need to account for both spatial (anatomical) and spectral (functional) information.

5. **Training and Validation:**
The DL model should be trained on a labeled dataset where the ground truth of distances and functional
connections is known. This allows the model to learn the mapping and distance estimation tasks, as well as the relationship between the functional connectivity patterns and the spatial configuration.

6. **Inference and Analysis:**
After training, the model can be used to map new MRI data onto the spherical surfaces, compute
distances, and assess functional connectivity while accounting for the spatial layout of the brain hemispheres. The correlation between FFT outputs from different regions can then be normalized by the logarithmic transformed distance measure.

7. **Statistical Correction:**
As with any multiple comparison problem, you'll need to correct for it using appropriate statistical
methods to ensure that your findings are not due to random chance.

4D+ MRI data analysis with deep learning can indeed incorporate the approach you've described, which involves Fourier transform (FFT) analysis, phase shifting, and modeling of brain distances using geometric shapes like spheres or toroids. Let's break down how each component can contribute to the overall goal of understanding brain structure and function, particularly in the context of Alzheimer's disease (AD) research:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Compute FFT and Cluster
\begin{itemize}
    \item The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is a computational algorithm that transforms a signal from time-domain into frequency-domain. In MRI, FFT can be used to analyze the frequency components of the signal, which may help in distinguishing between different types of tissues and detecting subtle changes associated with disease progression.
    \item After computing the FFT, clustering algorithms (like k-means or DBSCAN) can group similar features, potentially identifying patterns that are indicative of specific pathologies like AD.
\end{itemize}
\item Find $\phi$  Shift Between Vectors
\begin{itemize}
    \item The phase $\phi$ in the complex output of the FFT represents different aspects of the signal's waveform and can be crucial for interpreting the data correctly. By finding the shift between vectors that represent different regions of the brain, you can align these regions based on their underlying oscillatory activity, which is important for functional connectivity studies.
    \item Shifting all vectors to 0 (or a common reference phase) and calculating the average phase shift across subjects or time points can reveal consistent patterns of neural activity that may be disrupted in AD.
    \item The standard deviation (SD) of the phase shifts can provide additional information about the consistency and variability of this activity, which could be a useful biomarker for disease progression.
\end{itemize}
\item Model Brain Distances with 2 Spheres or Toroidal Shapes
\begin{itemize}
    \item Modeling brain distances using geometric shapes like spheres or toroids can help in understanding the spatial relationships between different brain regions, which is fundamental for assessing structural connectivity and atrophy patterns.
    \item Surface distances on a sphere (or a torus) are particularly useful when considering the curvature of the brain's surface. This approach can be more accurate than Euclidean distance measurements in certain scenarios, especially when dealing with complex folding patterns of the cerebral cortex.
\end{itemize}
\item Consider Connection Between Eyes and Back of Brain
\begin{itemize}
    \item The visual system's pathway extends from the eyes (retina) to the primary visual cortex located at the back of the brain (occipital lobe). Analyzing this connection can provide insights into how visual information processing is affected by diseases like AD.
    \item By tracking changes in the structural and functional integrity of this pathway over time, researchers can potentially identify early signs of AD or monitor disease progression.
\end{itemize}
\item Correlation/Distance Analysis
\begin{itemize}
    \item Correlation analysis between different brain regions can reveal how structural (anatomical) and functional connectivity may change with disease or treatment. This is particularly relevant in understanding the impact of AD on neural networks.
    \item Distance metrics, especially those derived from 4D+ MRI data, can quantify anatomical changes that accompany disease progression or treatment response.
\end{itemize}
\item Application in Alzheimer's Disease
\begin{itemize}
    \item The approaches described can be specifically applied to AD research by tracking the progression of atrophy, changes in white matter integrity, and alterations in functional connectivity patterns.
    \item By modeling brain distances with spheres or toroids and analyzing the connection between the eyes and the back of the brain, researchers can identify disease-specific patterns that could serve as biomarkers for early detection, diagnosis, and monitoring of disease progression.
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

Incorporating these methods into a deep learning framework allows for the automatic and robust analysis of large datasets, which is essential in preclinical studies involving mouse models of AD. Deep learning models can learn complex patterns in the data, integrating multimodal information from MRI scans to provide a comprehensive understanding of brain health and disease processes. This holistic approach can lead to better diagnostic tools, more effective treatments, and ultimately, improved patient outcomes.

\section{Change in the communcation speed in the brain cause by the progression of Alzeimers}
%### ASSISTANT
4D+ MRI data, which includes information on both structure and function over time (i.e., diffusion MRI for structure and functional MRI for activity), can be a powerful tool for studying changes in communication speed within the brain due to the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here's how you can approach this with the methodology you've outlined:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) and Connectomics}
\begin{itemize}
\item DTI is a type of MRI that tracks water diffusion in brain tissue, which provides information about the integrity of white matter fibers, including their orientation and speed of signal propagation.
\item Connectomics involves mapping out the connections between different brain regions using DTI data. This can reveal how AD affects the structural connectivity and potentially the communication speed along these pathways.
\end{itemize}
item \textbf{Fourier Analysis and FFT}
\begin{itemize}
\item By applying FFT to functional MRI (fMRI) data, you can analyze the frequency components of brain activity, which may be altered in AD.
\item Time-frequency analysis can further help in understanding how the spectral content of brain signals changes over time and with disease progression.
\end{itemize}
item \textbf{Phase Analysis}
\begin{itemize}
\item The phase information from FFT can indicate the timing and synchrony of neural oscillations. Altered phase synchronization is a feature observed in AD, which could be used to assess changes in communication speed between different brain regions.
\end{itemize}
4item \textbf{Dynamic Causal Modeling (DCM}
)\begin{itemize}
\item DCM is a technique that combines fMRI with biophysical models of neural interactions and uses inverse reasoning to infer causal relationships between different brain regions.
\item By applying DCM, you can model the effective connectivity and identify changes in communication speed due to AD.
\end{itemize}
5item \textbf{Quantitative Analysis of Communication Speed}
\begin{itemize}
\item To quantify changes in communication speed specifically, you can use metrics such as:
  \item Diffusion anisotropy (FA) values from DTI to assess the integrity of white matter tracts. Lower FA values may indicate slower communication due to disrupted myelination or fiber tract damage.
  \item Transfer entropy, which measures the directional dependency between time series in different brain regions. This can be used to assess changes in information flow and effective connectivity over time.
  \item Phase locking value (PLV) or other measures of phase synchrony from fMRI data to evaluate the timing consistency between neural oscillations across subjects or over time.
\end{itemize}
\item \textbf{Machine Learning and Deep Learning}
\begin{itemize}
\item Employ deep learning models, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image analysis or recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for sequence modeling, to automatically detect changes in communication speed from MRI data.
\item These models can learn complex patterns and features that are indicative of AD progression, potentially leading to early detection and better understanding of the disease's impact on brain connectivity.
\end{itemize}
item \textbf{Modeling with Spheres or Torus Shapes}
\begin{itemize}
\item By considering the geometric shapes that best represent brain distances, you can refine models of communication speed, taking into account the actual 3D structure of the brain and its curvature.
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Application in Alzheimer's Disease:}

 By combining these methods, you can track how communication speed changes over time in AD patients compared to healthy controls. This comprehensive approach allows for the identification of early biomarkers of disease progression and can inform therapeutic strategies aimed at preserving or restoring normal communication speeds within the brain networks affected by AD.

In summary, a multimodal analysis combining structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging data with advanced machine learning techniques is a promising approach to study changes in communication speed in the brain due to Alzheimer's disease. This can lead to early diagnosis, better understanding of disease mechanisms, and the development of novel interventions tailored to modulate brain connectivity and slow down the progression of AD.

\section{Defineing the process}
%let me explain the idea in a bit more detail. 
For each point across tie, compute a vector. Do an FFT for these vectors and then compute the pairwise similarity matrix. Cluster these (using cluster editing). Having found these clusters consider the original (non FFT) data. and compute the shift in the data within each cluster. Report the average amounts and SD for shift $\phi$. Next, for the FFT pairwise data, consider those areas that are not adjacent by weighting the similarity measure (e.g., divide it by 1/log distance).

%### ASSISTANT
%Your approach is a sophisticated method to analyze changes in communication speed across the brain, particularly in the context of Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of your proposed methodology:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Compute Vectors Across Time}
\begin{itemize}
\item For each spatial location (e.g., voxel or ROI) in the brain, obtain time series data across multiple time points.
\item Create vectors representing the time course of neural activity or signal propagation for each location.
\end{itemize}
\item \textbf{Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)}
\begin{itemize}
\item Apply FFT to these vectors to convert the time-domain signals into the frequency domain.
\item Obtain the frequency components for each spatial location, which can represent different aspects of neural activity or communication speed.
\end{itemize}
\item \textbf{Pairwise Similarity Matrix}
\begin{itemize}
\item Compute the pairwise similarity between the FFT representations of all spatial locations. This could be done using a distance metric like Euclidean distance between vectors in the frequency domain.
\item Construct a similarity matrix where each element represents the similarity between a pair of locations.
\end{itemize}
\item \textbf{Clustering}
\begin{itemize}
\item Use clustering algorithms such as hierarchical clustering or k-means clustering on the similarity matrix to group spatially distant (non-adjacent) brain regions with similar frequency patterns.
\item Refine the clusters using cluster editing to remove any outliers and ensure that the clusters are compact and well-separated.

\end{itemize}
\item \textbf{Non-FFT Data Analysis}
\begin{itemize}
\item For each cluster identified from the FFT data, examine the corresponding non-FFT (time-domain or structural) data to compute the shift in communication speed (\(\phi\)).
\item This could involve comparing the time series data of the cluster members and calculating the average shift and standard deviation within each cluster.
\end{itemize}
\item \textbf{Weighting Non-Adjacent Clusters}
\begin{itemize}
\item For pairs of clusters that are not spatially adjacent (i.e., not directly connected by a white matter tract), weight the similarity measure based on the logarithm of the distance between their centroids or representative locations.
\item This weighting accounts for the spatial distribution and could reveal patterns of communication speed that are not limited to directly connected regions.
\end{itemize}
\item \textbf{Analysis of Weighted FFT Data}
\begin{itemize}
\item Consider the areas identified as non-adjacent but similar in terms of their FFT representations.
\item Analyze the weighted similarity matrix to identify potential long-range or indirect communication pathways that may be affected by AD.
\end{itemize}
\item \textbf{Reporting Findings}
\begin{itemize}
\item Report the average shift in communication speed (\(\phi\)) for each cluster, along with its standard deviation.
\item Discuss how these shifts correlate with the progression of AD and any observed changes in the functional connectome.
\end{itemize}
\item \textbf{Interpretation and Hypothesis Generation}
\begin{itemize}
\item Use the clustering results and identified shifts to generate hypotheses about the underlying neural mechanisms affected by AD.
\item Determine if there are patterns of communication speed alterations that precede or correlate with the onset or progression of clinical symptoms in AD.
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
This approach combines spatial and temporal information, leveraging the strengths of both structural and functional MRI data to understand the dynamic changes in brain connectivity associated with Alzheimer's disease. It also accounts for the complex nature of brain organization by considering both adjacent and distant interactions, which is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of the disease's impact on brain networks.

\section{Correlation vs. Distance in Brain Connectivity}

In the context of neuroimaging studies, particularly when using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) and Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI),
examining the relationships between correlation and distance is crucial for understanding brain connectivity.

\subsection{Correlation Analysis}

Correlation analysis in neuroimaging is primarily used to assess functional connectivity, which refers to the temporal correlations of neural activity.

\subsection{Distance Metrics}

Distance measures, on the other hand, are crucial for understanding spatial relationships and structural connectivity between brain regions. DTI data
can provide valuable insights into this aspect.

\section{Analyzing Correlation vs. Distance}

\subsection{Objective}

Investigate how functional connectivity (measured by correlation) is related to anatomical proximity (as measured by distance).

\subsection{Steps}

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Correlation Between Correlation and Distance}: Analyze the relationship between functional connectivity (correlation coefficients) and
structural connectivity (distance).
\item \textbf{Partial Correlation}: Adjust the correlation coefficients for distance to isolate functional connectivity that is not merely a function of
anatomical proximity.
\item \textbf{Statistical Modeling}: Use multivariate statistical methods to understand how multiple factors, including distance, contribute to observed
connectivity patterns.
\end{enumerate}

When studying diseases like Alzheimer's, integrating correlation and distance analysis can help identify patterns that are specific to disease
progression.

fMRI data).
\item \textbf{Distance Matrices}: Calculate the geodesic or Euclidean distances between all pairs of ROIs for DTI data.
\item \textbf{Comparison and Analysis}: Compare the distance matrices with the functional connectivity matrices to explore the relationships between
structural and functional connectivity patterns.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Processes details}
\subsection{ Step 1: Preprocessing}
\textbf{fMRI and DTI Preprocessing}: Apply standard preprocessing steps to your data, including motion correction, spatial normalization, and
smoothing. Ensure that your data are aligned with a standard anatomical space for both modalities.

\subsection{ Step 2: Feature Extraction}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{fMRI Time Series Extraction}: For each voxel, extract the time series data.
\item \textbf{DTI Feature Extraction}: Extract features such as fractional anisotropy (FA) or other diffusion measures that can capture the structural
integrity of white matter.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{ Step 3: FFT Transformation}
\textbf{Apply FFT to fMRI Data}: Transform the time series from each voxel using FFT to obtain the representation of the frequency domain. This step reveals
the power spectrum and phase information, providing insights into functional connectivity.

\subsection{ Step 4: Feature Vector Creation}
\textbf{Combine FFT and DTI Features}: For each voxel or region of interest (ROI), create a feature vector that includes the FFT coefficients as well as relevant DTI measures. This vector encapsulates both functional and structural information.

\subsection{ Step 5: Cluster Editing}
\textbf{Apply Cluster Editing Algorithm}: Use cluster editing to identify the smallest set of edge modifications that transform the graph (representing
the brain network) into a cluster graph. This approach helps to group voxels or ROIs with similar characteristics in the frequency and diffusion
domains.

\subsection{ Step 6: Clustering Evaluation}
\textbf{Evaluate Clusters}: Assess the quality of the clusters using metrics such as cohesion, separation, and stability. Compare these clusters to
known anatomical or functional regions to validate their relevance.

\subsection{ Step 7: Statistical Analysis}
\textbf{Compare Clusters Between Groups}: Perform statistical tests to determine if there are significant differences in cluster characteristics
between healthy controls and Alzheimer's disease patients. This analysis can pinpoint specific patterns associated with the disease.

\subsection{ Step 8: Visualization and Interpretation}
\textbf{Visualizeusters and Features}: Use visualization tools to explore the spatial distribution of the clusters and their associated features. This
step aids in understanding the changes in brain structure and function linked to Alzheimer's.

\subsection{ Step 9: Validation and Replication}


\section{Calculating Phase Shift between Two FFT Vectors}
To find the phase shift $\phi$ between two test vectors obtained from a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), you can follow these detailed steps:

\noindent \textbf{Step } 1: Compute the Phase of Each Vector
After applying the FFT to your data, you will have complex numbers for each frequency component. The phase of a complex number $z = a + bi$ (where $a$
and $b$ are the real and imaginary parts, respectively) is given by:
$\phi(z) = \arctan\left(\frac{b}{a}\right)$
However, since the standard arctan function does not fully account for the quadrant of the complex number, you should use the more comprehensive
$\arctan2$ function, which considers the signs of both the real and imaginary parts to correctly determine the phase angle in the range $[-\pi, \pi]$.

\noindent \textbf{Step } 2: Align the Vectors
Ensure that the vectors are aligned in terms of frequency. This means that the $i$-th element of each vector should correspond to the same frequency
component. If there are differences in sampling rates or preprocessing steps, you may need to adjust the vectors through interpolation or other methods
to achieve alignment.

\noindent \textbf{Step } 3: Calculate the Phase Shift $\phi$
Subtract the phase of one vector from the phase of the other vector to find the phase shift:
$\phi_{\text{shift}} = \phi_2 - \phi_1$
The phase shift calculated this way will be in radians. Due to the periodic nature of the phase, the phase shift may initially be outside the range $[-\pi,\pi]$. To correct for this, add or subtract multiples of $2\pi $ as necessary to ensure that the phase shift falls within this range.

\noindent \textbf{Step } 4: Handle Phase Wraparound
Phase differences can sometimes result in large phase shifts due to the periodic nature of the phase angle. To correct for this, you can adjust the phase
difference by adding or subtracting $2\pi $ until the phase difference lies within the range $[-\pi,\pi]$. This adjustment ensures that the smallest possible
angular difference between the two phases is calculated.

\noindent \textbf{Example Implementation in Python}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=Python]
import numpy as np

def phase_shift(vector1, vector2):
    # Ensure vectors are of the same length
    assert len(vector1) == len(vector2)

    # Compute the phase of each vector
    phases = []
    for z in [complex(x, y) for x, y in zip(vector1, vector2)]:
        phi = np.arctan2(z.imag, z.real)
        phases.append(phi)

    # Calculate the phase shift
    phi_shift = phases[1] - phases[0]

    # Correct for phase wraparound
    while phi_shift > np.pi:
        phi_shift -= 2 * np.pi

    return phi_shift
\end{lstlisting}


\section{Shift and align the vectors}
To align vectors, follow these steps:


\noindent \textbf{Step} 1: Choose the Alignment Feature
Identify the feature that will be used for alignment (e.g., a specific peak, frequency component, or any other distinctive characteristic present in all
vectors).

\noindent \textbf{Step} 2: Compute Shifts

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{For Phase Shifts (Frequency Domain):}
If your vectors are in the frequency domain (obtained via FFT), calculate the phase shift required to align each vector with the reference feature.
Ensure the phase shift is adjusted to remain within $[-\pi , \pi ]$.
\item \textbf{For Time Shifts (Time Domain):}
If your vectors are in the time domain, use cross-correlation to find the time lag that maximizes the similarity between each vector and the selected
alignment feature.
\end{itemize}

\noindent \textbf{Step} 3: Apply the Shift

\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{For Phase Shifts:}
Apply the calculated phase shift to each complex number in the vector. This can be achieved by multiplying each complex number by a complex number with
the calculated phase shift.

\item \textbf{For Time Shifts:}
Apply the calculated time lag to shift the vector in the time domain. This may involve truncating or padding the vector, or using interpolation to adjust
the time axis.

\end{itemize}

\begin{lstlisting}[style=Python]
import numpy as np

def align_signals(signals, peak_index):
    # Calculate the time shift for each signal relative to the peak of the first signal
    shifts = []
    for i in range(1, len(signals)):
        cross_corr = np.correlate(signals[0], signals[i], mode='full')
        shift = np.argmax(cross_corr) - (len(signals[0]) - 1)
        shifts.append(shift)

    # Apply the shifts to align the signals
    aligned_signals = [signals[0]]  # Add the reference signal which is already aligned
    for i, signal in enumerate(signals[1:]):
        aligned_signal = np.roll(signal, shifts[i])
        aligned_signals.append(aligned_signal)

    return aligned_signals
\end{lstlisting}

%### Example Usage
%To use the `align_signals` function, you would need a list of signals and the index of the peak that you want all signals to align with. Here's how you might use it:

%```python
%# Example data
%signals = [np.sin(np.linspace(0,

\section{Compute Averate Vectors}
After aligning your vectors using the phase shift$\phi$  or other alignment methods, you can proceed to compute the average vector, standard deviations, and analyze the shifts in phase angles. Here's a detailed guide on how to do it:

\noindent \textbf{Step } 1: Compute the Average Vector
The average vector is calculated by summing the corresponding elements of all aligned vectors and dividing by the number of vectors. This step is essentially finding the central tendency of your data.

\[
\text{Average Vector} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \text{Vector}_i
\]

\noindent \textbf{Step } 2: Calculate Standard Deviations (SD)
The standard deviation for each element in your vectors measures the dispersion or variability of the data points around the average. Use the following formula:

\[
\text{SD} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N-1} \sum_{i=1}^{N} (Vector_i - \text{Average Vector})^2}
\]

\noindent \textbf{Step } 3: Analyze Shifts in Phase Angle$\phi$ 
If you have computed phase shifts between vectors to achieve alignment, you can further analyze these shifts to understand the typical adjustment needed and the variability around this adjustment.

\noindent \textbf{Compute Average Shift of$\phi$ :} Calculate the average of phase shifts to understand the typical adjustment.
\noindent \textbf{Compute SD of Phase Shifts:} Calculate the standard deviation of phase shifts to understand the dispersion around the average shift.

\noindent \textbf{Implementation in Python}
Here's how you can implement the calculations in Python using the `numpy` library:

\begin{lstlisting}[style=Python]
import numpy as np
def compute_stats(vectors):
    # Compute the average vector
    average_vector = np.mean(vectors, axis=0)
    # Compute standard deviation
    std_dev = np.std(vectors, axis=0, ddof=1)  # ddof=1 for sample standard deviation
    # If phase shifts have been calculated, compute their average and SD
    if phase_shifts is not None:
        average_shift = np.mean(phase_shifts)
        std_shift = np.std(phase_shifts, ddof=1)
    else:
        average_shift, std_shift = None, None
    return average_vector, std_dev, average_shift, std_shift
\end{lstlisting}
