# Design: Deployment/Clinical Level (F₆)

**Task ID**: PH-6
**Functor Level**: F₆ (Deployment)
**Biological Level**: Level 6 (Cellular/System)
**Priority**: Low
**Status**: Not Started

## Overview

F₆ addresses clinical translation, regulatory approval, manufacturing scale-up for LOC/OOC devices.

## Scope

### Clinical Translation
- ❌ Clinical validation framework
- ❌ FDA/CE regulatory pathway documentation
- ❌ Clinical trial design (diagnostics, drug screening)

### Manufacturing
- ❌ Scale-up from lab prototype to production
- ❌ Quality control protocols
- ❌ Cost analysis and optimization

### Deployment
- ❌ Point-of-care implementation
- ❌ Operator training materials
- ❌ Field validation studies

## Future Considerations

- Regulatory qualification (FDA, EMA)
- Reimbursement strategy (CPT codes, pricing)
- Market analysis (target applications, competitive landscape)
- IP strategy (patents, trade secrets)

## FPT Parameters

- Deployment site count (N_sites)
- Patient/sample count (N)
- Clinical trial size
- Regulatory endpoint count

Note: This level represents long-term (12-24 month) objectives beyond current research scope.
