To investigate the properties of knot-like structures from first principles, one needs a theoretical model where knots emerge as solitons, that is, as stable finite energy solutions to the pertinent nonlinear field equations. The literature on solitons is enormous, and there are several extensive reviews. However, until now the activity has mainly concentrated on one dimension with the notable exceptions of the two-dimensional vortex and nonlinear CT-model soliton, and skyrmeons and 'tHooft-Polyakov monopoles in three dimensions. These are all point-like configurations, and can not be directly associated with knot-like structures. When embedded in three dimensions, a point-like two-dimensional soliton becomes a line vortex. For a finite energy, its length must be finite which is possible ifits core forms a knot. In 1975 one of us proposed14' 15 that closed, knotted vortices could be constructed in a definite dynamical model. The explicit solution conjectured in refs 14, 15 has the shape of a doughnut; it is a closed torus-like vortex ring, twisted once around its core before joining the ends to ensure stability against shrinking. In knot theory this closed vortex corresponds to the unknot, the simplest possible knot-like structure. However, despite numerous attempts no such stable configuration has been constructed, neither by explicit analysis nor by a numerical investigation.
